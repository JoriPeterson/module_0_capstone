##Array Methods

1. **sort** - The sort method rearranges the elements in an array either in alphabetical order or ascending numerical order.

1. **each** - Each lets you iterate (apply a method) to each individual element within an array.

1. **join** - Join takes the elements outside of the array and merges all elements into a single string (with no spaces).

1. **index** - Index allows you to call out an element by it's name and it will deliver it's position within the array.

1. **include?** - Tells you `true` or `false` if an element is included in an array.

1. **collect** - Collect creates a new array adding a given command (in my case adding a "?") to each element in the original array.

1. **first** - Returns the first element within an array.

1. **last** - Returns the last element within an array.

1. **shuffle** - Randomly shuffles elements within an array. I got a different output each time a ran the command.
