## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.

  A conditional statement is something that evaluates whether the statement is true or false, based on the conditions set.

  1. If I have money, then I can go out to dinner.
  1. If I did cleaned the house and I have the day off, I can go climbing this weekend.
  1. If I don't have the day off, then I cannot go out and play.

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?

  We can use if-statements to tell the computer what to do if it has multiple options. It gives the computer instructions to follow if a statement is true or false.

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement?

  - If this is true
    - puts this
  - elsif the statement above was false, but this is true
    - puts this
  - else if neither of the above are true
    - puts this
  - end  

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?

  I feel like we need if to create a conditional statement in the first place. I did read that "unless" can be used as a negative version of if.
